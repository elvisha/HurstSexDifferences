# Sex differences in long-term temporal dependence of rs-fMRI time series

This repository contains all of the MATLAB and Python based implementation of the work described in: 
Dhamala E., Jamison, K., Kuceyeski, A. Sex differences in long-term temporal dependence of resting state fMRI time series. Poster presented at: 25th Annual Meeting of the Organization of Human Brain Mapping; 2019 June 9-13; Rome, Italy.

Full paper currently in preparation.

Keywords: fMRI, resting-state fMRI, hurst exponent, temporal dependence, temporal dynamics, sex classification, sex differences, 

This MATLAB and Python based implementation is catered to the HCP-S1200 dataset where we focus on: 
(1) computation of hurst exponent (measure of long-term temporal dependence) from resting-state fMRI data using multiple parcellations (atlases)
(2) statistical analysis of sex differences at an ROI-level using different parcellations
(3) machine learning sex classification using hurst exponent data using different parcellations
